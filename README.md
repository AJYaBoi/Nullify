iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly watch the result of a greedy corporation that doesn't try in the SLIGHTEST to make their product enjoyable, or even acceptable. This repository is a collection of hacks and a chrome extension that ensures nobody has to suffer through iReady ever again. The current version has a lesson, quiz skipper, and a minutes hack.

I am not the creator of this project, I am constanting updating the program to work with iReady's code. THIS is a cheat, I am not responsible if iReady sends info to your teachers that you are using this program it is not my fault. credit to ArjhanToteck for originally making this and also cupiditys (but they both deleted their project.)
